## 1) Mission & Values

### Mission
Restore confidence and safety for people with memory loss through dignified, privacy-first assistive technology.

### Core values and how we behave
- **Dignity**
  - Use people-first language. Avoid deficit framing.
  - Ship features that reduce stigma (visible indicators, discreet form factors).
- **Consent**
  - Get informed consent before recording or identifying anyone.
  - Honor revocation fast. Build obvious ways to say ‚Äúno.‚Äù
- **Safety**
  - Treat safety incidents as Sev-0 until proven otherwise.
  - Test fall detection and SOS paths weekly in staging.
- **Privacy by default**
  - Process on-device first. Keep buffers short. Minimize collection.
  - Default to opt-in. Log all access to PII/PHI.
- **Caregiver empathy**
  - Design flows for families with shared responsibilities and stress.
  - Communicate clearly. No surprises.
- **Clinical rigor**
  - Separate product claims from hypotheses. Label pilots.
  - Follow evidence and document acceptance criteria.
- **Accessibility**
  - Meet or exceed WCAG 2.2 AA for apps and portal.
  - Provide non-voice and non-touch fallbacks.
